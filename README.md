## 📝 Overview

This project analyzes the **FIFA 20 Player Dataset** to understand player performance, skill patterns, and natural groupings among footballers across various attributes.

By performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applying **Clustering (Unsupervised Machine Learning)**, we aim to:

- Discover hidden patterns in player skills, attributes, and physical abilities
- Identify natural player groups such as attackers, playmakers, defenders, and physically strong players
- Understand country-wise football talent distribution
- Analyze how age impacts a player's overall rating and performance
- Compare salary trends across attacking positions (ST, RW, LW)
- Provide data-driven insights to support football analytics, scouting, and team-building decisions

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Task 1:** Prepare a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) report on the FIFA 20 dataset.

**Task 2:** Explore football skills and cluster players based on their attributes using unsupervised machine learning.

**Task 3:** Answer the following football analytics questions:
- Top 10 countries producing the most football players
- Age at which players stop improving (Overall vs Age)
- Which attacking position earns the most: **ST, RW, or LW?**
